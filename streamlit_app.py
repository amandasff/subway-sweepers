    st.write("""
    Subway Sweepers was born from a clear need: improving how urban environments handle waste. 
    Inefficient cleaning methods in public spaces lead to persistent litter problems. 
    Our solution is a self-contained robot that detects, collects, and properly disposes of trash.
    By using a Raspberry Pi with YOLO-based object detection and an Arduino for precise control, 
    Subway Sweepers offers a practical and sustainable approach to keeping public areas cleaner.

def what_it_does_page():
    st.markdown("## What It Does")
    st.write("""
    Subway Sweepers is a solar-powered robot designed for urban waste management. It uses a 
    Raspberry Pi running a YOLO-based object detection system to identify trash in real time. 
    Upon detection, the robot uses a scooping mechanism and distance sensors to collect trash 
    and deposit it in the proper disposal location. This system is optimized for environments 
    such as city roads, subways, and other public spaces.

    Our project combines both hardware and software innovations:
    - **Computer Vision:** A Raspberry Pi is paired with a webcam and LCD monitor. Using YOLO and OpenCV, the system identifies a wide range of objects.
    - **Control System:** An Arduino processes sensor data and converts it into navigation commands, allowing the robot to move autonomously.
    - **Sustainable Power:** Solar panels power the system through a USB-A to USB-C connection.
    - **Mechanical Design:** Rotary motors and a repurposed can plow work together to enable effective trash collection.

    Throughout the development of Subway Sweepers, we encountered several challenges:
    - Establishing a reliable connection between the Raspberry Pi and the LCD display.
    - Overcoming mechanical difficulties in assembling the rotary motor and plow mechanism.
    - Integrating various hardware components to function seamlessly together.
    These challenges drove us to innovate and refine our approach, ultimately resulting in a more robust system.
